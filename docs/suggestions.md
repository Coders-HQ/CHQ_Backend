4. how can someone use current expertise to claim points ? (open-source activity ?)
5. How will this info be displayed ? 
6. what are other sets of information we can put ?

__Suggested answers__

1. The point system should include, contribution, engagement, activity, number of challenges attempted/completed, offers by companies, GitHub points, companies should be able to select challengers who made good progress and give them points. Maybe a Q/A system like stack overflow.  (we can define some of are later)
2. More weight should be given to harder tasks, so completing challenges successfully should be given the most, being afforded a position in a company, selected by a private entity should also be highly weighted. Then challenges which are not completed should be given points depending on % completed. GitHub points, engagement and other social activities should follow that.
3. The points should be weighted properly and either combined into one large system or into a social/technical category, preferably have the social/technical hidden.
4. Need to determine relevancy of expertise, (forking a lot of other repos should not be included but successful pull requests should be).
5. As simple as having a number next to their name/profile, when hovered over, it describes simple analytics (# of challenges participated in, number of successful answers, age in CHQ).
